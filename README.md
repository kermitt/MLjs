# MLjs

Currently still just in the TDD.js and Library.js...  later, once I've created all the backing functions in the Library.js file ( and TDD to test them ) then I will build out the BackPropogationNetwork.js file.

NOTE! Profs to Ryan Harris's neuralnet videos...  Better than Udemy.com. :)

Unrelated: Why does the code formatting in github disagree some much with my local copy? Grr.
